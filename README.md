# DDoS

**DDoS** is a Python-based Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack simulator. This tool is created for **educational purposes only** to demonstrate how DDoS attacks work in a controlled and ethical environment.

> **Important**: This tool is not intended for malicious use. Unauthorized use of this tool is illegal. You are solely responsible for how you use this tool. Use it at your own risk.

## Features

- **Target IP Simulation**: Attack a specified IP address.
- **Randomized Ports**: The attack sends packets over random ports between `1-65535`.
- **Loading & Progress Bar**: Displays a professional loading animation before starting the attack and shows the progress bar while the attack is running.
- **User-Friendly**: Colorful and interactive console output using `colorama` for better visualization.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Handle user interruption (Ctrl+C) and any exceptions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `colorama` library

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:

    python ddos.py
    ```

## Usage

1. **Launch the tool**: 
    ```bash
    python ddos.py
    ```

2. **Input the target IP address** when prompted.

3. The tool will start simulating the DDoS attack with a randomized port selection.

4. **Press Ctrl+C** to stop the attack.
